### estimate difference in mean muscle mass for women differing in age by one year
### the difference =~ b1 = -1.19

### estimate mean muscle mass for women aged 60 years
predict(reg, data.frame(x=60)) # 84.95

### find value of 8th residual
resid <- residuals(reg)
resid[[8]] # 4.44

### find estimate of sigma squared
(summary(reg)$sigma)^2 # 66.80
